we compare adjacent elements 

first pass : 

    3 1 5 4 2 
    1 3 5 4 2
    1 3 4 5 2 
    1 3 4 2 5 

    with the first pass through the array the largest element came to the end 

second pass : 

    1 3 4 2 5 
    1 3 2 4 5 

third pass : 

    1 3 2 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5 

also know are sinking sort and exchange sort 

in these no extra space is required they are also known as inplace sorting algorithm.


static void bubble(int[] arr){
    //run the steps n-1 times 
    for(int i =0; i < arr.length; i++){
        //for each step , max item will come at the last respective index 
        for(int j = 1; j < arr.length-i;j++){
            //swap if item is smaller than the previous item 
            if(arr[j] < arr[j-1]){
                //swap 
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j-1];
                arr[j-1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

}

stability : yes
